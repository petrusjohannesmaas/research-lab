# Back-End (Server-Side) Development

## Overview
Back-end development refers to the server-side logic that powers web applications behind the scenes. It handles data processing, business logic, authentication, and communication with databases and APIs. While the front-end interacts with users, the back-end ensures everything works smoothly under the hood.


## Objectives of Back-End Development
- Manage data storage and retrieval
- Authenticate and authorize users
- Handle business logic and workflows
- Serve data to front-end via APIs
- Ensure security, scalability, and performance


## ️ Core Technologies

| Technology | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Programming Languages** | Python, JavaScript (Node.js), Java, PHP, Ruby, Go |
| **Web Frameworks** | Django, Flask, Express.js, Spring Boot, Laravel |
| **Databases** | PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis |
| **Protocols** | HTTP/HTTPS, WebSockets, REST, GraphQL |
| **Authentication** | JWT, OAuth2, Session-based auth |


## Server-Side vs Client-Side

| Feature              | Server-Side                          | Client-Side                         |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Runs on              | Web server                           | User's browser                      |
| Languages            | Python, Node.js, PHP, etc.           | HTML, CSS, JavaScript               |
| Security             | More secure (logic hidden)           | Less secure (code exposed)          |
| Use Cases            | Data processing, authentication      | UI rendering, form validation       |
| Speed                | Depends on server and network        | Fast (local execution)              |


## Server-Side Responsibilities

### API Development
- Create RESTful or GraphQL endpoints
- Handle HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

### Database Interaction
- Query, insert, update, and delete records
- Use ORMs (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Prisma) or raw SQL

### Authentication & Authorization
- Secure login systems
- Role-based access control

### Business Logic
- Implement workflows, calculations, and rules
- Validate and sanitize input data

### Error Handling & Logging
- Gracefully handle exceptions
- Log events for debugging and monitoring


## Best Practices

- **Modular Code:** Separate concerns using MVC or layered architecture
- **Security:** Sanitize inputs, hash passwords, use HTTPS
- **Scalability:** Use caching, load balancing, and asynchronous processing
- **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests
- **Documentation:** Use tools like Swagger/OpenAPI


## Example: Simple REST API with Flask
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

app = Flask(__name__)
items = []

@app.route('/items', methods=['GET'])
def get_items():
    return jsonify(items)

@app.route('/items', methods=['POST'])
def add_item():
    item = request.json
    items.append(item)
    return jsonify(item), 201

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
