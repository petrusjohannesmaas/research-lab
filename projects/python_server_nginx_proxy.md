Absolutely! Setting up Nginx as a reverse proxy for `python3 -m http.server` while securing it with HTTPS is a great project. This approach ensures encrypted traffic while still serving files with Pythonâ€™s built-in server.

### **Project Overview:**
**Objective:** Use Nginx as a reverse proxy with HTTPS, forwarding requests to a local Python HTTP server (`python3 -m http.server`).  
**Use Case:** Securely serve internal files or basic web content over HTTPS using self-signed certificates.

### **Step-by-Step Guide**

#### **1. Install Nginx**
If Nginx is not installed, install it with:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nginx -y
```
Verify it's running:
```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

#### **2. Generate Self-Signed Certificates**
```bash
mkdir -p /etc/nginx/certs
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout /etc/nginx/certs/server.key -x509 -days 365 -out /etc/nginx/certs/server.crt -subj "/CN=localhost"
```
This creates:
- `server.key` (Private Key)
- `server.crt` (Self-signed Certificate)

#### **3. Configure Nginx to Proxy Python HTTP Server**
Edit the Nginx configuration file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/python_server
```
Add the following:
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name localhost;

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/certs/server.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/certs/server.key;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;  # Redirect to Python HTTP server
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```
Save and exit.

#### **4. Enable the Configuration**
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/python_server /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

#### **5. Start Python HTTP Server**
In your working directory, run:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

#### **6. Test HTTPS Setup**
Open a browser and navigate to:
```
https://localhost
```
You may need to accept the self-signed certificate security warning.

### **Bonus Enhancements**
- **Auto-Renew Certificates:** Integrate this with your Bash script to handle certificate renewals.
- **Add Basic Auth:** Secure Nginx further with authentication (`htpasswd`).
- **Serve Python API Instead:** Proxy a Flask or FastAPI server instead of static files.
