That’s a fantastic approach! Simulating IoT devices with Go binaries running in separate containers gives you control over data generation, network conditions, and scaling.

Here’s how you could structure your multi-container setup:

1. **Mock IoT Devices (Go binaries in containers)** – Each container represents a different Smart Home device (e.g., a thermostat, light sensor, or motion detector). These binaries send telemetry data at regular intervals.
2. **Ingestion Service** – A separate container that collects incoming IoT data via MQTT, HTTP, or another protocol and forwards it to processing services.
3. **Storage (Database Layer)** – PostgreSQL, InfluxDB, or a time-series database to store the collected data.
4. **Processing & Analytics** – A service that processes raw data, applies transformations, and prepares it for visualization.
5. **Dashboard / Visualization** – A frontend powered by Grafana or another visualization tool to display real-time insights from the IoT data.

You could leverage Docker Compose to define and manage these services efficiently. Do you want to explore how to configure the mock device containers, or are you interested in setting up data ingestion first?
