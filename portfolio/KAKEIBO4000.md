#### Who is the audience and what problem will it solve?

##### Purpose:
To save more and spend more mindfully

##### Objectives:

1. **Encourage mindful spending habits** – Guide users through the Kakeibo method by prompting reflection on purchases and financial decisions.
2. **Simplify budgeting** – Offer a user-friendly interface with flexible budget categories that accommodate different budgeting styles.
3. **Boost financial confidence** – Provide insights, analytics, and easy-to-understand financial summaries to help users take control of their money without stress.
4. **Motivate consistent savings** – Implement goal-setting features where users can track savings progress visually and receive encouragement along the way.
5. **Integrate the envelope budgeting philosophy** – Enable users to allocate funds to different spending categories in a way that mimics the traditional envelope method.
6. **Prioritise security and data privacy** – Ensure robust security measures to protect financial data while maintaining a smooth user experience.

##### Target audience:
- **Inconsistent budgeters:** If you’ve had trouble sticking to budgets in the past, Kakeibo’s simplicity and flexibility might do the trick.
- **Fearful or reluctant budgeters:** Kakeibo is good at banishing the idea anyone is “bad with money.” The method puts you in charge of your spending, giving users more control and confidence.
- **First-time savers:** The “start anywhere” approach celebrates even the smallest savings goals and motivates you to save more along the way.
- **“Envelope” budgeters:** Kakeibo’s categories resemble the “envelope budgeting” method where you plan monthly expenses ahead of time and distribute fixed amounts into physical or virtual envelopes. If envelope-style planning works for you, you’ll probably like Kakeibo.

##### Requirements:
- Don't be to overly complicated
- The point of the application is to have something to show for your skills and experience.

#### What do they want?
**User Research**:

  - Collect data on user needs, behaviors, and pain points through surveys, interviews, and usability testing.
  - Create user personas to guide design decisions.
- Conduct **Market Research**:
  - Analyze competitors and identify market trends.
  - Find opportunities for differentiation and innovation.

#### Figure out the technology stack
- Select the appropriate tools, libraries, and frameworks for:
  - Front-end development (e.g., React, Vue.js, or plain HTML/CSS/JS).
  - Back-end development (e.g., Node.js, Python Django, etc.).
  - Hosting and deployment platforms.

#### Initialize a starter template (if exists)
- Set up a basic project structure with relevant directories (e.g., `src/`, `assets/`, `styles/`).
- Include any available templates or boilerplates for faster implementation.
- See [[Starter project SOP]]

#### Build the MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- Digital ledger
- Calculate monthly income and subtract fixed expenses
- Set savings goal on a monthly basis
- List spending categories
- Categorise everything you buy
- Answer four reflection questions on a weekly / monthly basis
- Design the **Content**:
  - Write clear and engaging copy.
  - Source or create visuals, videos, and any multimedia content.
- Develop the **Design**:
  - Create a mockup or wireframe for layout, color palette, and navigation.
  - Ensure responsive and accessible design principles are in place.

#### Break each feature into small tasks
- Use the insights from user and market research to:
  - Plan core features and prioritize them (e.g., navigation, forms, etc.).
  - Break each feature into small, actionable tasks (e.g., "Create header navigation" or "Set up contact form validation").
  - Assign tasks to team members or track them in a project management tool.

#### Start versioning
- Use **Code** to implement the design and functionality:
  - Set up a version control system like Git.
  - Initialize a repository and commit initial work.
  - Follow a clear branching strategy (e.g., main/development/feature branches).
- Iterate on user feedback, ensure testing, and release updates.
